<h1>How to Share News on Facebook in Canada</h1>
Bill C-18, the Online News Act, compels technology companies to compensate news publishers for using their journalism. In response, Meta is ending access to news on its social media sites for Canadian users. Canadians who post a link to a news article ‚Äì domestic or international ‚Äì will find the post blocked. This response prevents access to vital journalism. 

<h1>Workarounds</h1>
These workarounds allow Canadians to continue sharing news on Facebook.

<h2>Share a Screenshot</h2>
<p>Share a screenshot of a news story. A screenshot is an image, not a link, and will not be blocked. A screenshot of a news story will usually provide a picture and essential data to find the original story, such as title, author, and timestamp. 

<h2>Share a Disabled Link</h2>
Modify the news link to disable it. You can modify it yourself or use the following tool:
<ol>
<li>Insert a news story link in the first box.</li>
<li>Click the Modify Link button. The tool inserts a maple leaf emoji üçÅ to disable the link and to highlight that this is an issue for Canadians.</li>
<li>Click the Copy to Clipboard button and paste the modified link in Facebook. It will not generate a preview and it will not be blocked.</li>
<li>Readers can copy and paste the edited link into a browser, remove the maple leaf, and then read the original news story.</li>
</ol>

<p><input type="url" name="url" id="url" placeholder="https://news.com" pattern="https://.*" size="100" required />
<p><input id="butModify" type="button" value="Modify link" onclick="modifyurl();" />

<p><input type="text" name="urlnew" id="urlnew" size="100" />
<p><input id="butCopy" type="button" value="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copynew();" />

<h2>Share a Secondary Link</h2>
For now, people can still post links on other digital platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter). You can look up new stories with links on these platforms and share them on Facebook. These secondary links are not currently being blocked. Your readers can click through your Facebook link to the original news story link. It is unclear if these other platforms will respond to Bill C-18.

<h1>Other Options</h1>
<h2>Copy-Paste the Story Text</h2>
Some news publishers allow readers to copy-paste the full text of a story. Look for the licensing agreement. There is a risk that a malicious user could change the original text. Even if the text was transferred accurately, readers will not get updates from the news source.

<h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>
A VPN can make a user appear to be in another country than Canada. Initial tests indicate that Facebook is using additional methods to detect the user‚Äôs location and block links.  

<h2>Apps, Websites, Email</h2>
People can continue to use traditional online methods of sharing news, such as news apps and websites, and email. It is a cause to reflect. Social media was created to improve the user experience of the web, to make it easy for everyone to participate. Blocking news is a step backward.
